However, around 2300 BCE, a young man who had been a cupbearer to the king of Umma became the leader of a new group of Semitic-speaking people from the north of Mesopotamia who took control of all of the Sumerian cities. This young man, who gave himself the title King Sargon (“the legitimate king”), set about building an empire that eclipsed everything the Sumerians had achieved.

Just when it appeared to be so powerful that no one could stand against it, the Akkadian Empire collapsed, partially due to a long-lasting drought and subsequent famines which swept through Mesopotamia and beyond. When Shu-turul, the last king of Akkad, was deposed in 2154 BCE, the area descended into anarchy as the Gutians, a warlike hill tribe from the Zagros Mountains, swept across Mesopotamia.

Many Sumerian cities regained their independence by paying tribute to the Gutians. The Akkadian people who had formed the ruling class of the Akkadian Empire went both to the south and north. In the south, they went to the city of Babylon, which would itself become the center of an empire. In the north, they congregated in the city of Ashur on the west bank of the Tigris River in the north of modern-day Iraq.

Under the rule of Sargon, the city was enlarged, new temples were built, and many traders and merchants came to the city. When the Akkadian Empire collapsed, Ashur regained some form of independence, and it seems to have avoided the worst effects of the drought and famine which affected large parts of Mesopotamia; in the period 2200 to 2000 BCE, several large cities in the area were completely abandoned, seemingly as a direct consequence of the drought. Around 2100 BCE, Ashur became part of the Third Dynasty of Ur (also known as the Neo-Sumerian Empire).

At this time, Ashur was ruled by Erishum II, a direct descendant of Puzur-Ashur I. By now, the rulers of Ashur had started to use the title king, but Erishum II would be the last king of the Puzur-Ashur dynasty. In 1809 BCE, Erishum II was deposed and replaced by a new king of Ashur, Shamshi-Adad I. We know nothing about the circumstances in which the new king took the throne, but we do know that Shamshi-Adad I was an Amorite and that he immediately began strengthening his city.

These kings included Eriba-Adad II, Ashurnasirpal I, Ashur-rabi II, and Tiglath-Pileser II. They are not remembered in the same way as Assyrian kings who led successful campaigns of conquest, but this comparison is unfair; their policy of simply maintaining the empire at a time when so much around them was disintegrating was an essential step towards ensuring that, when the effects of the Bronze Age Collapse began to lessen, the Assyrians would be in a good position to resume their domination of the region.

The premature death of Adad-nirari II in 783 BCE led to a series of relatively ineffective rulers (Shalmaneser IV, Ashur-dan III, and Ashur-nirari V) and 40 years of internal revolt and the rebellion of occupied territories. This was exacerbated by a plague that swept the country, and by 745 BCE, the Assyrian Empire was in serious trouble. Disease and civil war had reduced the once-mighty empire to ruins, and even the capital, Kalhu, had joined with the rebels. Then an Assyrian general named Pulu staged a coup, seized the throne, and named himself King Tiglath-Pileser III.

With his new army, Tiglath-Pileser III set about reconquering those lands which had attempted to break free of Assyrian control during the period of civil war. Babylon was attacked and subdued, the Medes and Persians were defeated, and the Neo-Hittites were brought back under Assyrian control. Tiglath-Pileser III also led a successful invasion of the kingdom Israel and forced it to pay an annual tribute to Assyria.

The Assyrian throne was then claimed by Shalmaneser V’s brother who named himself King Sargon II. The new king started a dynasty that would lead the Assyrian Empire to its greatest extent and power. Sargon II consolidated Assyria’s hold over captured territories and expanded into the lands of Elam. He also occupied the city of Babylon and had himself crowned king of Babylon and built yet another capital city, Dur-Sharrukin (“Fortress of Sargon”), near the existing city of Nineveh.

Still, the Assyrian king never forgot or forgave the murder of his son, and in 689 BCE, Sennacherib took advantage of a dispute over the succession in Elam to attack and completely destroy the city of Babylon. He also destroyed the temple to the god Marduk at the center of the city and brought the statue of the god from that temple back to Nineveh. This act of sacrilege horrified even the Assyrian people, who shared many gods with the Babylonians, and in 681 BCE, Sennacherib was murdered by his own eldest sons, reputedly as a punishment for his defiling the temple and stealing the statue of Marduk.

The war between Ashurbanipal and Shamash-shum-ukin raged for four years, leaving large areas of Mesopotamia devastated and depopulated. It finally ended in 648 BCE when Assyrian troops took Babylon and Shamash-shum-ukin set fire to the royal palace, killing himself in the process. Ashurbanipal then turned on those who had supported his brother. He invaded the Arabian Peninsula and killed the Arab kings Abiate and Uate. The Chaldean tribes in the southeast of Mesopotamia were attacked, defeated, and placed under Assyrian control. Elam was attacked and its capital, Susa, was sacked.

had left Assyria short of manpower for its armies and short of the resources required to keep a large standing army equipped and fed. Many of the provinces from which tribute could be expected had been devastated during the civil wars and were unable to contribute significantly to the maintenance of the empire. Even the sheer size and geographic spread of the empire made it difficult for the king to maintain direct control. Many vassal states and even supposed allies began to wonder whether it might be possible to make a bid for independence. Somehow King Ashurbanipal was able to hold the tottering empire together during his lifetime, but when he died circa 627 BCE, the empire disintegrated more quickly than anyone could have foreseen.

He was opposed in a continuing civil war by Sin-shar-ishkun. Fighting between factions was bitter and protracted, but around 626 BCE, Sin-shar-ishkun was able to take the throne.

In 616 BCE, Nabopolassar, king of Babylon, made an alliance with the Median king, Cyaxares, against Assyria, and the Scythians and Cimmerians were persuaded to join. Suddenly, Assyria was facing overwhelming numbers of enemies on every side. For four years, bitter fighting between the forces of this confederation and the Assyrians led to a gradual reduction in Assyrian territory until, in 612 BCE, the city of Nineveh was taken and sacked and King Sin-shar-ishkun was killed.
