However, around 2300 BCE, a young man who had been a cupbearer to the king of Umma became the leader of a new group of Semitic-speaking people from the north of Mesopotamia who took control of all of the Sumerian cities. This young man, who gave himself the title King Sargon (“the legitimate king”), set about building an empire that eclipsed everything the Sumerians had achieved.

Just when it appeared to be so powerful that no one could stand against it, the Akkadian Empire collapsed, partially due to a long-lasting drought and subsequent famines which swept through Mesopotamia and beyond. When Shu-turul, the last king of Akkad, was deposed in 2154 BCE, the area descended into anarchy as the Gutians, a warlike hill tribe from the Zagros Mountains, swept across Mesopotamia.

Many Sumerian cities regained their independence by paying tribute to the Gutians. The Akkadian people who had formed the ruling class of the Akkadian Empire went both to the south and north. In the south, they went to the city of Babylon, which would itself become the center of an empire. In the north, they congregated in the city of Ashur on the west bank of the Tigris River in the north of modern-day Iraq.

Under the rule of Sargon, the city was enlarged, new temples were built, and many traders and merchants came to the city. When the Akkadian Empire collapsed, Ashur regained some form of independence, and it seems to have avoided the worst effects of the drought and famine which affected large parts of Mesopotamia; in the period 2200 to 2000 BCE, several large cities in the area were completely abandoned, seemingly as a direct consequence of the drought. Around 2100 BCE, Ashur became part of the Third Dynasty of Ur (also known as the Neo-Sumerian Empire).

At this time, Ashur was ruled by Erishum II, a direct descendant of Puzur-Ashur I. By now, the rulers of Ashur had started to use the title king, but Erishum II would be the last king of the Puzur-Ashur dynasty. In 1809 BCE, Erishum II was deposed and replaced by a new king of Ashur, Shamshi-Adad I. We know nothing about the circumstances in which the new king took the throne, but we do know that Shamshi-Adad I was an Amorite and that he immediately began strengthening his city.

These kings included Eriba-Adad II, Ashurnasirpal I, Ashur-rabi II, and Tiglath-Pileser II. They are not remembered in the same way as Assyrian kings who led successful campaigns of conquest, but this comparison is unfair; their policy of simply maintaining the empire at a time when so much around them was disintegrating was an essential step towards ensuring that, when the effects of the Bronze Age Collapse began to lessen, the Assyrians would be in a good position to resume their domination of the region.

The premature death of Adad-nirari II in 783 BCE led to a series of relatively ineffective rulers (Shalmaneser IV, Ashur-dan III, and Ashur-nirari V) and 40 years of internal revolt and the rebellion of occupied territories. This was exacerbated by a plague that swept the country, and by 745 BCE, the Assyrian Empire was in serious trouble. Disease and civil war had reduced the once-mighty empire to ruins, and even the capital, Kalhu, had joined with the rebels. Then an Assyrian general named Pulu staged a coup, seized the throne, and named himself King Tiglath-Pileser III.

With his new army, Tiglath-Pileser III set about reconquering those lands which had attempted to break free of Assyrian control during the period of civil war. Babylon was attacked and subdued, the Medes and Persians were defeated, and the Neo-Hittites were brought back under Assyrian control. Tiglath-Pileser III also led a successful invasion of the kingdom Israel and forced it to pay an annual tribute to Assyria.

The Assyrian throne was then claimed by Shalmaneser V’s brother who named himself King Sargon II. The new king started a dynasty that would lead the Assyrian Empire to its greatest extent and power. Sargon II consolidated Assyria’s hold over captured territories and expanded into the lands of Elam. He also occupied the city of Babylon and had himself crowned king of Babylon and built yet another capital city, Dur-Sharrukin (“Fortress of Sargon”), near the existing city of Nineveh.

Still, the Assyrian king never forgot or forgave the murder of his son, and in 689 BCE, Sennacherib took advantage of a dispute over the succession in Elam to attack and completely destroy the city of Babylon. He also destroyed the temple to the god Marduk at the center of the city and brought the statue of the god from that temple back to Nineveh. This act of sacrilege horrified even the Assyrian people, who shared many gods with the Babylonians, and in 681 BCE, Sennacherib was murdered by his own eldest sons, reputedly as a punishment for his defiling the temple and stealing the statue of Marduk.

The war between Ashurbanipal and Shamash-shum-ukin raged for four years, leaving large areas of Mesopotamia devastated and depopulated. It finally ended in 648 BCE when Assyrian troops took Babylon and Shamash-shum-ukin set fire to the royal palace, killing himself in the process. Ashurbanipal then turned on those who had supported his brother. He invaded the Arabian Peninsula and killed the Arab kings Abiate and Uate. The Chaldean tribes in the southeast of Mesopotamia were attacked, defeated, and placed under Assyrian control. Elam was attacked and its capital, Susa, was sacked.

had left Assyria short of manpower for its armies and short of the resources required to keep a large standing army equipped and fed. Many of the provinces from which tribute could be expected had been devastated during the civil wars and were unable to contribute significantly to the maintenance of the empire. Even the sheer size and geographic spread of the empire made it difficult for the king to maintain direct control. Many vassal states and even supposed allies began to wonder whether it might be possible to make a bid for independence. Somehow King Ashurbanipal was able to hold the tottering empire together during his lifetime, but when he died circa 627 BCE, the empire disintegrated more quickly than anyone could have foreseen.

In 616 BCE, Nabopolassar, king of Babylon, made an alliance with the Median king, Cyaxares, against Assyria, and the Scythians and Cimmerians were persuaded to join. Suddenly, Assyria was facing overwhelming numbers of enemies on every side. For four years, bitter fighting between the forces of this confederation and the Assyrians led to a gradual reduction in Assyrian territory until, in 612 BCE, the city of Nineveh was taken and sacked and King Sin-shar-ishkun was killed.

The following list provides the names and regnal years of Assyria’s most important rulers in the somewhat simplified rendering, without special characters, that is used for ancient Near Eastern names throughout this book. The number preceding each ruler’s name indicates his position within the Assyrian King List (AKL), an Assyrian chronicle known from first-millennium BCE copies. The available manuscripts of the AKL come to an end with Shalmaneser V (no. 109); the numerals preceding the names of the kings following him continue the AKL’s numbering system, running from 110 to 117. Ititi and Zarriqum are not mentioned in the AKL but are included in the list below because of their historical importance, while the names of several rulers who feature in the AKL but are otherwise poorly attested are excluded. If known, the names of the principal wives of the Neo-Assyrian kings are mentioned below as well, marked by italics.

The regnal dates of the kings from Tiglath-pileser I (no. 87) onward can be determined with complete accuracy, while there is a certain margin of error for those of the earlier kings. The dates provided for the Old Assyrian rulers follow Gojko Barjamovic, “Assur Before Assyria” (forthcoming). In accordance with Mesopotamian calendrical practices, the first year given for a specific ruler is not his accession year but his first full year in office. Thus, Shalmaneser III (AKL 102) is said to have ruled from 858 to 824 BCE, even though he actually ascended the throne at some point in 859 BCE.

Their efforts, initially aimed at the reconquest of areas that had been under Assyrian rule before and then moving farther afield, were carried out with unsparing and often violent determination, cruelly epitomized in an aphoristic statement found in another of Esarhaddon’s inscriptions: “Before me, cities, behind me, ruins.”

The Book of Jonah, popular and widely read, claimed that Nineveh was so large that it took three days to walk across from one end to the other—and that God had forgiven the Ninevites their sins when they repented. The Book of Nahum painted a much darker picture, comparing Nineveh to a debased prostitute and describing the city’s impending destruction, brought about by God to punish Assyria’s imperial hubris. In a variety of Greek and Latin texts from classical antiquity, Assyria appeared as the first in a long succession of empires, founded by King Ninus and his colorful wife Semiramis and destroyed by Babylonians and Medes during the reign of Assyria’s last king, Sardanapalus, an effeminate debauchee.

After the second century CE, no one knew any longer how to read the cuneiform script in which the Assyrians, as well as the Sumerians, Babylonians, and other people of the ancient Near East, had recorded royal inscriptions, literary works, medical treatises, letters, title deeds, and administrative documents.

The “real” Assyria—rather than the distorted image the Bible and the classical texts conveyed of it—began to regain its place in the historical consciousness of the modern world on April 5, 1843, when a forty-one-year-old Frenchman by the name of Paul-Émile Botta sat down at his desk in the city of Mosul to write a letter. Botta was the French consul in Mosul, at the time a remote provincial town on the outskirts of the Ottoman Empire, but his letter was not about politics. Addressed to the secretary of the Société Asiatique in Paris, it was about a spectacular archaeological find. During the previous days, Botta revealed, some of his workmen had dug up several strange and intriguing bas-reliefs and inscriptions near the small village of Khorsabad, some 25 kilometers (15 miles) northeast of Mosul. At the end of his letter, Botta proudly announced, “I believe I am the first to discover sculptures that may be assumed to belong to the time when Nineveh was still flourishing.”4

At the same time, the nineteenth century had also brought to the fore a strong taste for historical inquiry, aiming at a reconstruction of the past “as it actually happened.” Exploring ancient Assyria promised important insights into the historical truth of the stories told in the Bible and was thus an endeavor very much in line with the historicist spirit of the age.6

Finally, there was for the first time an opportunity to actually study Assyrian and other archaeological sites in the region. The rise of France and Britain to leading imperial powers enabled ambitious and ruthless European men eager to make their mark to travel to and explore faraway places. To be sure, the Ottoman state—unlike substantial swaths of Africa and Southeast Asia—was not an imperial province of any European country. But its political fragility facilitated interventions on the part of the great European powers—including some of a scholarly nature. The most famous of these was the archaeological exploration of Egypt during Napoleon’s campaign of the years 1798 to 1801, which eventually led to the decipherment of Egyptian hieroglyphs by Jean-François Champollion in 1822. Compared to Napoleon’s scientific expedition to Egypt, in which a whole army of scholars participated, the rediscovery of Assyrian sites around Mosul in the 1840s and 1850s was a very lonely affair, drawing on the labor of a few European explorers and their local workmen.

The results of their efforts, however, were spectacular. The first major breakthrough was owed to Botta, who uncovered at Khorsabad a massive Assyrian palace and parts of a city surrounded by a wall some 7 kilometers (about 4 miles) long. The city, as would eventually transpire, had been called Dur-Sharrukin in Assyrian times and had been built by the Assyrian king Sargon II (r. 721–705 BCE). Luckily for the excavators, the Neo-Assyrian kings had lined the mudbrick walls of their palaces with large stone blocks, or orthostats. This made it possible to easily trace the outline and structure of the buildings, which at Khorsabad were located close to the surface. The images found on the orthostats, and the sculptures of colossal winged bulls uncovered in several palace gates, provided the first glimpses into the world of the ancient Assyrians after the downfall of the Assyrian kingdom some 2,500 years earlier.

In 1845, two years after Botta had initiated excavations at Khorsabad, a young Englishman by the name of Austen Henry Layard, an amateur archaeologist and protégé of the influential British ambassador to Constantinople, Sir Stratford Canning, began exploring another Assyrian site, located some 32 kilometers (20 miles) downstream from Mosul on the eastern bank of the Tigris. Known to local people as Nimrud, it turned out to be a royal city by the name of Kalḫu (or Calah, as it is called in the Hebrew Bible). Within just a few months, Layard and his resourceful assistant Hormuzd Rassam, a Chaldean Christian from Mosul, uncovered on Nimrud’s main acropolis hundreds of meters of bas-reliefs depicting royal campaigns, hunting expeditions, and mythological scenes, as well as numerous monumental inscriptions no one was initially able to read. They even found the platform for the throne of the ninth-century BCE Assyrian king Shalmaneser III, with an image of that king and a Babylonian ruler shaking hands, the first known pictorial representation of this widely used gesture.

The archaeological site closest to Mosul, a large area surrounded by massive walls on the other, eastern side of the Tigris, had initially yielded no major finds—even though it seemed from early on likely that it was here that Nineveh, Assyria’s most famous city, had once prospered. Nahum’s invectives notwithstanding, Nineveh’s ancient name had never been entirely forgotten. The site where the city’s ruins lay buried under layers and layers of earth and debris was known to the local population as Nuniya. Moreover, a mound by the name of Nebi Yunus on the southwestern edge of the site was the location of a mosque built over what people believed to be the burial place of the biblical prophet Jonah (Yūnus in Arabic), whose life’s journey, according to scripture, had ended in Nineveh (see Plate 3). Western visitors to the Middle East had been interested in the site of Nuniya, and its potential to yield ancient treasures, for quite a while. In 1820, the British resident for the East India Company in Baghdad, Claudius Rich, had spent some time in and around Mosul. At Nebi Yunus, he was shown relief slabs accessible from an underground kitchen, and he returned from his visit with a number of antiques, including a clay cylinder inscribed all over in a strange, unknown writing system. This created appetite for more. In fact, Botta’s assignment to Mosul had originally been motivated by a desire to expand Rich’s very limited earlier attempts to explore the area. Between December 1842 and March 1843, the French consul conducted excavations at Kuyunjik, a large mound located about a kilometer (0.62 miles) north of Nebi Yunus. But when his attempts to find noteworthy artifacts at that site led him nowhere, he turned his attention to Khorsabad. It was thus Layard whose name became inextricably linked to the rediscovery of Nineveh.

Between 1846 and 1851, Layard’s workmen, digging deeper than Botta’s and using a network of tunnels, uncovered on the southwestern side of Kuyunjik yet another enormous Assyrian palace, with relief slabs lining walls altogether more than 3 kilometers (1.8 miles) long. Perhaps most importantly, they also unearthed in several rooms of the palace thousands of baked clay tablets inscribed in the same script found on many of the orthostats that lined the palace walls. In May 1847, the Louvre in Paris became the first European museum to put Assyrian artifacts on public display, astonishing visitors with monumental works created in a completely unfamiliar artistic language. Never keen on playing second fiddle, the British Museum soon followed suit, and eventually other museums in Europe and the United States did so as well. It was the beginning of an “Assyromania” that swept for a few decades across the Western world, influencing fashion, art, and design.

Transporting the often huge objects from their remote locations in the area around Mosul to the capitals of the West was no easy feat. The bull colossi from the palace gates weighed up to 40 or 50 metric tons (44 to 55 US tons), and the methods applied by the excavators to haul them to the Tigris, where they were put on rafts, were no more advanced than those used by the ancient Assyrians themselves. On one occasion, in 1853, tragedy led to the loss of countless invaluable objects from an Assyrian site: the rafts carrying more than two hundred artifact-filled crates from Khorsabad down to Basra, where they were to be loaded onto a ship headed for France, sank in the marshes south of Baghdad, and everything, including drawings and field notes, was lost.

To be sure, in the mid-nineteenth century, and for quite some time to come, the removal of archaeological finds from their places of origin was common practice. But the fact that the exploration of archaeological sites in the Middle East began as an essentially “Western” project has undoubtedly contributed to the sense of alienation that many local communities in the region feel regarding the pre-Islamic past. This surely was a factor in the looting and deliberate destruction of many Assyrian sites by the Islamic State group in 2015 and 2016.9

During the late 1840s and early 1850s, while the excavations at Khorsabad, Nimrud, and Nineveh went on, several scholars in Britain and France began to study the strange writing found on the orthostats, bull colossi, and clay objects that had come to light at these sites. Because of the wedge-shaped nature of the basic elements of individual signs, the script became known as cuneiform, from the Latin word cuneus, which means “nail” or “wedge.”

Luckily, a late sixth-century BCE rock inscription from Bisitun in the Kermanshah Province of Iran provided some help. It included three versions of the same text, written in three different “cuneiform” scripts: Elamite, Babylonian, and Old Persian. The Old Persian version had been deciphered in 1838, and scholars realized early on that the Babylonian writing found at Bisitun was structurally identical with the script found at Assyrian sites farther north. It also helped that Assyrian and Babylonian were Semitic languages, like Hebrew and Arabic. The existence of such well-known cognates facilitated the process of reconstructing their grammar and recognizing the meaning of individual words. But since most of the roughly one thousand signs of the Assyro-Babylonian script have numerous readings and can render, depending on the context, both words and sounds, the decipherment of this writing system still required true genius.

The main breakthrough was owed to a modest but brilliant Irishman by the name of Edward Hincks, a clergyman from Killyleagh in County Down who collaborated closely with Layard. By 1852, Hincks had realized that the cuneiform signs “all represent syllables,” with “every vowel definitely expressed.” Hincks’s correct identification of the values of hundreds of signs allowed Layard, in his 1853 book Nineveh and Babylon, to provide remarkably accurate pioneer translations of some of the monumental inscriptions he had uncovered at Nineveh. Sensationally enough, among the events described in these texts was an attack by the army of the Assyrian king Sennacherib on Jerusalem in 701 BCE that was also described in the Bible.

In the mid-1850s, Edwin Norris, secretary of the Royal Asiatic Society in London, thought the time had come to put the results of the work done so far on the Assyro-Babylonian script to a test. Norris asked four scholars involved in the decipherment efforts to provide, independently of each other, transliterations and translations of a long Assyrian royal inscription. The text Norris selected was written on a large clay prism found at Qal’at Sherqat, an Assyrian site located some 50 kilometers (31 miles) south of Nimrud. Apart from Hincks, the scholars invited to participate in the challenge included the British army officer and orientalist Henry C. Rawlinson, who had played a key role in the decipherment of the Persian cuneiform script; the French-German orientalist Jules Oppert; and William H.F. Talbot, a British polymath best known for his work as a photography pioneer. When the translations submitted by the four in 1857 turned out to be largely identical, the decipherment of the Assyro-Babylonian cuneiform script could be considered accomplished, at least for the basics.

That the ancient Mesopotamians had used mudbricks made of clay for construction was a curse for modern explorers, since buildings made of such bricks are difficult to trace. But their use of clay for writing purposes turned out to be an enormous blessing: especially when baked, clay tablets, even though often found broken into pieces, are otherwise almost indestructible, and hundreds of thousands of them have been excavated all over Mesopotamia and neighboring areas up until now.

The tablets from Ashurbanipal’s libraries provided highly unexpected insights into Assyria’s intellectual, literary, and religious traditions. One of the most spectacular early discoveries was made by a self-taught young scholar by the name of George Smith. Originally a banknote engraver, Smith worked as an assistant in the British Museum, where almost all of the tablets from Ashurbanipal’s library had ended up. On a brisk November day in 1872, he looked at a few lines on a recently cleaned tablet and became so excited that he immediately began, in a rather un-Victorian manner, to undress. What Smith had found were parts of a Mesopotamian flood story so similar to the one known from the Hebrew Bible that there could be no doubt that the two traditions were closely related. When on December 3, 1872, Smith gave a lecture about the newly discovered Mesopotamian Noah to the Biblical Archaeology Society, even the British prime minister William Gladstone was in the audience. At least in Britain, it was the apogee of public interest in Assyria.

As systematic excavations in 1925 by the Czech researcher Bedřich Hrozný established, the tablets all came from a large mound by the name of Kültepe, located some 20 kilometers (about 12 miles) northeast of Kayseri. Kültepe, it transpired, was the site of the ancient city of Kanesh, where during the first centuries of the second millennium BCE a colony of merchants from Ashur, under the rulership of local kings, had been engaged over several generations in long-distance trade and other mercantile activities. The early excavations at Kültepe, and those conducted since 1948 by Turkish scholars, have produced some twenty-five thousand clay tablets from the archives of these businesspeople. The documents cast light not only on the commercial transactions in which the merchants were involved, but also on the surprisingly complex political organization of their mother city, Ashur, and many aspects of the private lives of the earliest Assyrians who have left us substantial numbers of written records.

Worship of the Assyrian state god Ashur also shaped Assyrian civilization through the ages. In fact, the god continued to play an important role even beyond the fall of the empire in 612 BCE—he is mentioned together with his wife Sherua in Aramaic votive inscriptions from as late as the second century CE. Those texts were discovered in the ruins of Ashur, the god’s sacred city, which embodies Assyria’s longue durée more than any other place. It was at Ashur that Assyrian civilization originated and where it later took its last breaths.

More concrete examples of continuity in Assyrian culture and history abound as well. A case in point is provided by the treaty tablets prepared in the name of the Assyrian king Esarhaddon in the spring of 672 BCE in order to secure the succession of Esarhaddon’s son Ashurbanipal to the Assyrian throne. The tablets, inscribed with loyalty oaths every Assyrian citizen and vassal had to swear, all feature the same three seal impressions: one from a seal from the time of Esarhaddon’s father Sennacherib; one from a seal from the Middle Assyrian period, roughly half a millennium earlier; and a third impression, showing a worshipper introduced by a goddess, from an Old Assyrian seal from the early second millennium, a good 1,200 years before Esarhaddon’s treaty tablets were written. As an inscription indicates, the last seal belonged to the god Ashur and the “City Hall,” an important civic institution in the early history of Ashur and one still in place, even though stripped of its former political power, in the seventh century BCE. The seal in question was apparently housed in the City Hall for more than a millennium.

Other buildings in Ashur, most prominently the temples, had long histories as well, which, in the case of the temple to Ishtar, the divine patroness of erotic love, stretched back nearly two millennia. Of course, as time went by, temples had to be repeatedly restored and rebuilt. The strong continuity that characterizes Assyria’s cultic sphere is also illustrated by the history of a group of minor deities known as the “seven divine judges.” An inscription of the twentieth-century BCE king Erishum I mentions that images of them were set up in the so-called Step Gate near the Ashur Temple on the northern edge of the city, a place where legal proceedings took place. Some 1,300 years later, the divine judges reappear in a text known as the Divine Directory of Ashur with only slightly modified names: the god Ṣê-raggu, “Get Out Criminal,” for instance, is now called Ḫip-raggu, “Break the Criminal.”20 Assyria’s material culture was marked by certain continuities as well. Several varieties of bread only known from Assyrian but not from Babylonian texts remained in use in Assyria from the fourteenth century BCE—and perhaps even earlier—to the final days of the empire. They include the so-called ḫuḫḫurtu bread, a braided or plaited loaf that may have been a forerunner of the challah eaten to this day on Jewish holidays. Bread, the “staff of life,” is a particularly important marker of identity, so the longevity of this unique bread type is perhaps not that surprising, and neither is the fact that cuneiform texts from Calah distinguish “Assyrian bakers” from Chaldean, Aramaean, and Suḫaean ones.

Assyrian texts and images of the first millennium BCE place great emphasis on continuity in the political sphere, with a strong focus on kingship. Images of Assyrian rulers, whether in the form of statues or on orthostats or stelae, depict them as an ideal, supra-individual type: a crowned, never-aging, manly and muscular figure with an elaborately coiffed beard, clad in precious robes, and free of emotions even when engaged in deadly battle with enemies or raging lions (see cover image and Plate 7). Although the images undergo stylistic changes over time, no Assyrian king is ever portrayed in the naturalistic manner that characterizes the marble busts of many a Roman emperor. It was the king’s “body politic” that Assyrian artists were expected to represent, not his “body natural,” burdened with sorrow and marked by sickness. Depictions of enemy leaders, in contrast, do occasionally display individual features.

The King List, known from several manuscripts from the first millennium BCE, records the names and genealogical backgrounds of more than one hundred Assyrian rulers, from the beginnings of Assyrian history down to the reign of Shalmaneser V (r. 726–722 BCE). The list promotes the idea that Assyrian kingship never dies—there is just “one damn King after another,” as a song by the British a cappella group The King’s Singers puts it. The Assyrian King List also stresses that royal power in Assyria was over long stretches of time handed down within one and the same family. This is in stark contrast to the earlier Sumerian King List, on which the Assyrian one was probably originally modeled, where history is presented as a never-ending transfer of power from one city, and one dynasty, to the next. Based on what is now known, there was indeed a good deal of dynastic continuity in ancient Assyria. For more than a thousand years, it seems that practically all Assyrian rulers were descendants of a certain Adasi, who had lived in the second half of the eighteenth century BCE. But in other respects, things were not quite as stable as the Assyrian King List, and the inscriptions of the Assyrian kings, wanted their readers to believe. Cuneiform chronicles, and especially letters from royal archives, tell stories quite different from those found in the official historical records. These are “hot” stories marked by high drama, with battles being lost, territories seized by the enemy, Assyrian kings murdered, and revolts and epidemics threatening to undermine the very foundations of the Assyrian state. It is, moreover, clear that power structures during the earlier phases of Assyrian history were not quite the same as those of later times. This is, in fact, suggested by the Assyrian King List itself, which mentions in its opening paragraphs “kings who lived in tents” or were “ancestors,” and talks in an unusual passage about one king, Shamshi-Adad I (r. ca. 1808–1776 BCE), who “came up” from the south and seized the Assyrian throne by force.

Middle and Neo-Assyrian royal inscriptions present Assyria’s history as an endless series of military conquests, all brought about by the Assyrian kings and the gods supporting them. As time passes, the inscriptions suggest, everything stays essentially the same, only getting “bigger and better.” This “cold” model of history writing, which strives to suppress any notion of real historical change as we would understand it, also informs large portions of the Assyrian King List, one of the most important historical documents ever recovered from ancient Assyria.

Countering Assyria’s reputation for violence, it seems, moreover, that Ashur was initially a remarkably peaceful polity. While many other states of the early second millennium were engaged in almost perpetual warfare, Ashur mostly stayed away from the fray, seeking gain through commerce rather than combat.

Later, from the mid-second millennium onward, this irenic attitude would give way to bellicosity and aggression. Ashur morphed into Assyria, a territorial state whose citizens were still interested in trade, but whose rulers found military assault a more lucrative way to accumulate wealth. To secure their power and stamp out any opposition that might arise, the later Assyrian kings would use a variety of coercive strategies, from targeted killings to mass deportations. The latter became a hallmark of Assyrian politics. During the first millennium, Assyrian armies forcefully moved hundreds of thousands of people to new settlements often hundreds of kilometers away from their original homes, transforming the ethnolinguistic landscape of Western Asia for all times to come. Such measures were not meant to produce only death and destruction. Assyria’s elites had an interest in economic development and sought to promote it in various ways, for example, by settling deportees in areas where their labor was needed. But unlike the rulers of the Old Assyrian period, those of later times did take delight in war for war’s sake. Parallel to and interrelated with these political transformations, the character of the Assyrian state god, Ashur, changed as well.

Parallel to and interrelated with these political transformations, the character of the Assyrian state god, Ashur, changed as well. In his early days, Ashur was something of a “god without qualities.” Most other major deities of the ancient Near East were complex figures with intriguing biographies. As cosmic entities, they represented celestial bodies; in mythology, they appeared as protagonists of stories in which they interacted with other gods and goddesses; and in their “political” capacities—to draw on distinctions established by the Roman polymath Varro—they were associated with specific cities or countries and worshipped in local temples dedicated to them. Ashur initially lacked the first two of these dimensions, in particular the mythological one. He did not have a family and was not celebrated in any grand narrative. Instead, Ashur was a numen loci—a deity essentially identical with, and at the same time protecting, the city with which he shared his name.

Instead, Ashur was a numen loci—a deity essentially identical with, and at the same time protecting, the city with which he shared his name. These limitations, however, did not make him any less powerful. In fact, Ashur was considered the actual sovereign of his city. As mentioned above, Ashur’s hereditary rulers initially abstained from calling themselves šarrum—the royal title was reserved for the god.25 The theocratic model established in Ashur in the twenty-first century BCE was never entirely abandoned. More than half a millennium later, the Assyrian priest performing the coronation ritual for the Assyrian ruler would still shout out “Ashur is king! Ashur is king!,” and a seventh-century BCE hymn from the reign of Ashurbanipal—who continued to be addressed as “Steward of Ashur”—contains the very same liturgical proclamation. But during the fourteenth century the Assyrian rulers began to claim the royal title, previously held exclusively by the god, also for themselves, while the god, in turn, assumed some of the belligerent qualities those rulers were now expected to possess.

Ashur also acquired a family over the course of Assyrian history. Already during Shamshi-Adad I’s “foreign” reign starting in the late nineteenth century BCE, he had been identified with Enlil of Nippur, the Babylonian “king of the gods.” This theological association was later revived, and Ashur was coupled with Enlil’s wife Ninlil, called Mullissu in Assyrian. The warrior god Ninurta, Enlil’s son, became a major figure in Assyrian royal ideology as well. During the early seventh century BCE, in yet another transformation, Ashur assumed the role of the Babylonian god Marduk as heroic vanquisher of Tiamat, the female embodiment of primeval chaos. The Babylonian “Epic of Creation,” originally composed to celebrate Marduk, was revised, with Ashur as its new protagonist.

though this rise was not a steady one. It was interrupted by several major crises. But as in the case of Rome, the final outcome was that Assyria morphed into a war-prone, multiethnic conqueror-state, organized into numerous provinces and geared toward moving resources on a massive scale from the periphery to the political center. In other words, Assyria grew into an empire.

Accordingly, many historians in the ancient and medieval worlds were convinced that Assyria should be considered an empire. For the Greek author Ctesias of Cnidus, the Roman Pompeius Trogus, or the Late Antique Christian writer Orosius, Assyria was the first in a linear succession of imperial states that were masters of large portions of the inhabited world. In the same vein, the Italian poet Dante Alighieri, drawing on the medieval concept of translatio imperii—the transfer of imperial power—argued that the first ruler to ever “gain the prize” of imperial rule was the Assyrian king Ninus.

Whereas an overwhelming portion of the written documents from Old Assyrian times concerns the economic activities of Ashur’s merchant class, most texts and images from Assyria’s imperial period are centered on the king and the state apparatus. Just as an illustration, in the house of the Old Assyrian merchant Usur-sha-Ishtar in Kanesh, some 1,600 clay tablets and 400 texts in envelopes have been found, providing ample material for a detailed study of this man and his family. From Neo-Assyrian times, no equally sized archives shedding light on the lives of commoners have survived. But a text corpus even larger than the documentation available for Usur-sha-Ishtar illuminates in often astounding detail the reign of the Assyrian king Ashurbanipal.

At first glance, quite a few aspects of Assyrian civilization appear strange and exotic to the modern observer. Whether it is the faith Assyrian kings placed in liver omens and astrological observations when making political decisions, the idiosyncratic religious rituals and magical practices in which the people of Assyria participated, the aggressive celebration of violence found in Assyrian royal inscriptions, or simply the Assyrian taste for locusts: the Assyrians were engaged in many pursuits that people of the twenty-first century may find at odds with their putatively more advanced and refined intellectual standards, political persuasions, or food preferences. Yet Assyria can also seem remarkably modern. The first “global” state, it combined imperial expropriation with shrewd commercial pursuits, the latter rooted in practices of an earlier period, when the city-state of Ashur was a kind of Singapore of the ancient Near East. Much like modern CEOs run their companies, Assyria’s imperial kings governed their state over long stretches of time with a focus on achieving the best possible balance between cost and benefits. The steely determination with which they pursued their goals seems quite in line with the scientific term used to designate the period when Assyria’s power climaxed: the Iron Age.

The Assyrian Empire also brought about a new “information age.” In their striving to better control the vast territorial expanses they ruled, the Assyrian kings commissioned new roads, way stations, and a postal system that facilitated communication between the center, the provincial capitals, and the kingdom’s periphery. Spies stationed in frontier zones would report on a regular basis on political developments and military movements that occurred in enemy territories and among Assyrian vassals. No longer slowed down by borders and seclusive rival states, commodities and ideas circulated more freely, with Assyria’s elites eagerly adopting foreign technologies and cultural practices whenever they promised to further their cause. At home, in the meantime, a network of informers sent letter after letter to the court to denounce anyone who seemed even remotely critical of the king and his administration. Besides Assyrian, a new vernacular, Aramaic, was now widely used, eventually taking on a role comparable to that played by English in the modern global world. Obviously, the Assyrians had no Internet, but the speed and frequency with which messages were sent back and forth throughout their empire was nothing short of revolutionary in its time.30

A recent hypothesis links Assyria’s fall to climate change, one of the great challenges of our time and a phenomenon that many expect to bring about the collapse of our own civilization. Evidence exists that prolonged drought conditions during the last century of the Assyrian Empire did indeed contribute to slowly decreasing harvests. Man-made ecological changes affected the imperial landscape as well: the intensified agricultural practices promoted by Assyrian governors in the Khabur region, and an endless series of hunting expeditions, led to the extinction of parts of the region’s megafauna, most notably its elephants. King Sennacherib decries, moreover, in an early testimony of ecological consciousness, that his royal predecessors had decimated the forests in order to get hold of enough timber for their ambitious building projects.

Whether climate change and the anthropogenic transformation of the biosphere were really the main causes of Assyria’s downfall is, however, not so clear. In fact, this book will argue that, paradoxically enough, these phenomena, along with various epidemics that ravaged Assyria around 760 BCE, may have contributed more to the emergence than to the demise of the Assyrian Empire. Although factors such as ecological degradation and foreign invasions probably played a role as well, Assyria’s fall may have been above all the result of leadership failures and autocratic delusions of grandeur—phenomena by no means alien to modern times either. Earlier centuries believed that Assyria represented a barbaric other. But this ancient civilization has actually much more in common with us than one might think. Assyria produced many features that, for better or worse, are still to be found in the modern world: from long-distance trade, sophisticated communication networks, and the state-sponsored promotion of literature, science, and the arts to mass deportations, the practice of engaging in extreme violence in enemy countries, and the widespread use of political surveillance at home. New research has shown that Assyria was affected, much as we are, by the outbreak of pandemics and the vicissitudes of climate change, and by how its rulers reacted to these challenges. Assyria, in other words, has much to teach us—and the time seems ripe to take a new look at this ancient state, which during its heyday morphed into the world’s first empire. 1

The Neolithic Revolution that set humanity, for better or worse, on the path to modernity was forged in a region known as the Fertile Crescent, a semicircular zone spanning from southern Palestine to Anatolia and then onward to the Zagros range in southeastern Turkey, Iraq, and Iran. Throughout this area, rainfall was plentiful enough to allow for settled farming. The region that would later form Assyria’s core, a triangle marked by the cities of Nineveh in the north, Arbela in the east, and Ashur in the south, lies in the northeastern segment of the Fertile Crescent.

Scientists rely on dopamine as a kind of universal currency for measuring the addictive potential of any experience. The more dopamine in the brain’s reward pathway, the more addictive the experience. In addition to the discovery of dopamine, one of the most remarkable neuroscientific findings in the past century is that the brain processes pleasure and pain in the same place. Further, pleasure and pain work like opposite sides of a balance.

Dopamine was first identified as a neurotransmitter in the human brain in 1957 by two scientists working independently: Arvid Carlsson and his team in Lund, Sweden, and Kathleen Montagu, based outside of London. Carlsson went on to win the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine. Dopamine is not the only neurotransmitter involved in reward processing, but most neuroscientists agree it is among the most important. Dopamine may play a bigger role in the motivation to get a reward than the pleasure of the reward itself. Wanting more than liking. Genetically engineered mice unable to make dopamine will not seek out food, and will starve to death even when food is placed just inches from their mouth. Yet if food is put directly into their mouth, they will chew and eat the food, and seem to enjoy it. Debates about differences between motivation and pleasure notwithstanding, dopamine is used to measure the addictive potential of any behavior or drug. The more dopamine a drug releases in the brain’s reward pathway (a brain circuit that links the ventral tegmental area, the nucleus accumbens, and the prefrontal cortex), and the faster it releases dopamine, the more addictive the drug.

According to the Hungarian-American psychologist Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi (pronounced ‘chick-sent-me-hi’), the biggest difference between climbing and, say, football, is that most climbers are completely immersed in the process (climbing the wall) rather than the end result (winning the game). The pioneer of the study of ‘flow’ – that state in which we’re so immersed in a task that the rest of the world seems to melt away – Csikszentmihalyi first developed his theories while watching climbers in the Alps as a teenager. Csikszentmihalyi argued that if we can we learn to focus on the process, rather than the outcome, we’re substantially more likely to enjoy a task.

And so Dicks decided to see if there was any joy to be had, not in the job’s outcome (his infuriatingly meagre pay cheque), but in the process instead. He landed on a classic tactic: upselling. ‘Some days I’d decide it was BBQ Sauce Day,’ he recalls. ‘So for the rest of the day, I’d add a mini sales pitch to each order I took. The customer would order a Big Mac and fries, and I’d ask them if they’d like any sauce with that. If they said no, I’d smile and say, “Well, I’d really recommend the BBQ sauce – there’s nothing that beats that.” Usually at this point, they were a little taken aback, and they’d say, “Ok then, I’ll take the sauce.” If they still didn’t bite, I’d say, “That’s ok, but you’re really missing out. My last customer was reluctant but when she tried the sauce she knew she’d made the right decision.”’ Dicks says that the effects of these little changes in his routine were unexpectedly significant. They were the kind of mini tasks that might, in his words: ‘just make the customer’s day a little better, and definitely made me feel more energised on days that felt like they were dragging’. And they worked. Dicks found himself looking forward to his shifts, eager to see how many people he could convince to try the BBQ sauce. The process was not inherently enjoyable. But Dicks had created a way to enjoy it. And in doing so, he had found the fun in an uninspiring situation.

If adventure and fun promote our ability to play, there’s a related, similarly potent factor that reduces that ability – stress.

As you might have guessed, Rober’s interest wasn’t really in teaching people to code. He was most interested in how we think about failure.

But what if there was a different way to look at failures? One that allows us to see them as inevitable,

In a talk where he shared the findings of this experiment, Rober asks: ‘If we could just frame our learning process so that we weren’t so concerned with failure, how much more could we learn? How much more could we succeed?’

Rober knew that getting a computer programme to work invariably requires a process of trying, failing and trying again. These supposed failures are not really failures, they’re ‘data points’ that we need to figure out how to succeed.

In the course of writing this book, I’ve often felt moved by Rober’s insight. Because his study offers a useful insight into how to reduce stress and, in turn, how to create an environment where you can play. Imagine what your life would look like if you received five proverbial points for failing, rather than losing five like in the experiment. Imagine what would happen if people cheered you on for a little stumble rather than humiliated you. Imagine how you’d approach things if you treated them as experiments, where failure would be just as valuable as success.

If your goal is to build a successful business, then your data collection process might involve testing different business ideas, products or services. With an experimental mindset, a product launch that doesn’t meet expectations wouldn’t be a failure or a disaster; it’d just be another data point to help you refine your strategy and better understand your target market.

And if your goal is to develop meaningful relationships, then your data collection process might involve going on dates, attending social events and engaging with new people. With an experimental mindset, a date that doesn’t lead to a second one or a friendship that doesn’t blossom wouldn’t be a failure; it’d just be another data point to help you understand your compatibility. No failure is ever just a failure. It’s an invitation to try something new.

you might focus on the process of completing each task, rather than becoming fixated on the end result. You might also seek out the input and collaboration of others, rather than trying to tackle the project on your own. By doing these things, you may find that it’s easier to approach it in the spirit of play, and that you’re better able to stay focused and motivated throughout.

There are three ways you can incorporate the spirit of play into your life. First, approach things with a sense of adventure. When you step into the right ‘play personality’, every day abounds with opportunities to see life as a game, filled with surprises and side quests. Second, find the fun. Remember Mary Poppins: there’s an element of fun in every task, even if it isn’t always obvious. Try asking yourself what this would look like if it were fun, and then build your projects around the answer. Third, lower the stakes. Failures are only failures when you think they are – and not every problem need be approached with such a straight face. So what would it mean to approach your work with less seriousness and more sincerity?
